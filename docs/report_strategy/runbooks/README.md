# SECOM Implementation Runbooks

These runbooks are execution checklists derived from the canonical strategy:

- `docs/final_end_to_end_report_strategy_merged.md`

Rule:

1. If any runbook line conflicts with the canonical strategy, the canonical strategy wins.
2. Runbooks are procedural aids for implementation order, validation gates, and artifact completeness.

Runbook sequence:

1. `01_data_contract_and_split.md`
2. `02_lane_a_replication.md`
3. `03_lane_b_stage_a_stage_b.md`
4. `04_phase2_phase3_freeze_lockbox.md`
5. `05_artifacts_and_claim_checks.md`
